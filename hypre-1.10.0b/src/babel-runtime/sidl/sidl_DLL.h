 *           borrows data from src, so modifying src or
 *           the returned array will modify both
 *           arrays.
 * 
 * dimen     this argument must be greater than zero
 *           and less than or equal to the dimension of
 *           src. An illegal value will cause a NULL
 *           return value.
 * 
 * numElem   this specifies how many elements from src
 *           should be taken in each dimension. A zero
 *           entry indicates that the dimension should
 *           not appear in the new array.  This
 *           argument should be an array with an entry
 *           for each dimension of src.  Passing NULL
 *           here will cause NULL to be returned.  If
 *           srcStart[i] + numElem[i]*srcStride[i] is
 *           greater than upper[i] for src or if
 *           srcStart[i] + numElem[i]*srcStride[i] is
 *           less than lower[i] for src, NULL will be
 *           returned.
 * 
 * srcStart  this array holds the coordinates of the
 *           first element of the new array. If this
 *           argument is NULL, the first element of src
 *           will be the first element of the new
 *           array. If non-NULL, this argument should
 *           be an array with an entry for each
 *           dimension of src.  If srcStart[i] is less
 *           than lower[i] for the array src, NULL will
 *           be returned.
 * 
 * srcStride this array lets you specify the stride
 *           between elements in each dimension of
 *           src. This stride is relative to the
 *           coordinate system of the src array. If
 *           this argument is NULL, the stride is taken
 *           to be one in each dimension.  If non-NULL,
 *           this argument should be an array with an
 *           entry for each dimension of src.
 * 
 * newLower  this argument is like lower in a create
 *           method. It sets the coordinates for the
 *           first element in the new array.  If this
 *           argument is NULL, the values indicated by
 *           srcStart will be used. If non-NULL, this
 *           should be an array with dimen elements.

 * The ordering parameter should be one of the constants
 * defined in enum sidl_array_ordering
 * (e.g. sidl_general_order, sidl_column_major_order, or
 * sidl_row_major_order). If you specify
 * sidl_general_order, this routine will only check the
 * dimension because any matrix is sidl_general_order.
 * 
 * The caller assumes ownership of the returned reference
 * unless it's NULL.
