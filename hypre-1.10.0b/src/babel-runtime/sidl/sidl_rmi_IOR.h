/*
 * Symbol "sidl.rmi" (version 0.9.3)
 * 
 * This package contains necessary interfaces for RMI protocols to 
 * hook into Babel, plus a Protocol Factory class.  The intention is 
 * that authors of new protocols will create classes that implement
 * InstanceHandle, Invocation and Response (they could even have one object
 * that implements all three interfaces).
