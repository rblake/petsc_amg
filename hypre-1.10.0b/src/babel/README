Babel Interface:

This directory contains the Babel wrappers for bHYPRE.  The building
instructions here assumes that Babel is already installed on the local
system and that the rest of bHYPRE is already constructed.

1.  Locate where the babel compiler is installed.  If
    Its already in your path, try `where babel`.
    It should look like /<some_path>/bin/babel.

2.  Type './configure --with-babeldir=/<some_path>'
    where <some_path> is the actual path that was determined
    in step 1.

4.  Type 'make'.  This will build the bHYPRE/libhypre_class.a.

5.  Type 'make check'.  This will build test/testum.
