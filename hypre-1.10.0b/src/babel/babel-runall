# Runs Babel to generate interfaces for standard languages.

# Output directories must be different so the make file babel.make
# won't get overwritten.  The server (-sC) directory name was chosen
# for backwards compatibility.

# Note that the version of Babel run here should be consistent with
# the version of the runtime Babel which is used in compiled bHYPRE
# code.  Here is how I get to the public version of Babel on the Casc
# network.  As of December 2002, it is consistent with runtime version
# 0.7.5, which is packaged with bHYPRE.  alias babel
