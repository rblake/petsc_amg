#=============================================================================

Version 1.10.0b released, 2005/12/19.

- configure updates
   -- config.guess and config.sub updated on 9/16/2005
   -- always runs --without-blas --without-lapack unless the user specifies otherwise
   -- cross-compiling enabled
   -- added --with-no-global-partition option
   -- updated insure options for compatibility with current version on CASC cluster

- makefile updates
   -- included BABEL
   -- changed eigensolvers subdirectory to multivector
   -- included insure related files to clean target

- Added a set of simple example codes covering the Struct, SStruct and IJ
  interfaces. See README.html in the examples subdirectory for more details.

- The --with-no-global-partition option was added to reduce storage
  and improve run times on very large numbers of processors (such as
  BlueGene/L). Currently only the IJ interface solvers have been
  optimized.  For small or modest numbers of processors ( typically <
  1000-5000 depending on the machine), this option is not needed 
  (and will likely be slower).
  
- Added aggressive coarsening, which can be applied to all available 
  coarsening schemes (via HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNumAggLevels and 
  HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNumPaths) 

- Added multipass interpolation and direct interpolation.

- Added the capability of nodal coarsening for systems AMG.

- expanded coverage of Babel-based interface

********************************************************************

Version 1.9.0b released, 2005/02/10.

- NOTE: Soft links NOT changed until 2/17/05 due to vacation.

- Added updated LOBPCG source code and test files.

- Updated autotest scripts for current set of platforms.

- Added a vector Laplace problem for testing systems AMG.

- Added FAC to semi-struct


Version 1.9.0a released, 2005/01/18.

- NOTE: Link lines may need to be changed depending on configure options used.

- The build system introduced in v1.8.3a was too difficult to maintain, so we
  have reverted to a system similar to the previous one.  In particular, all of
  the new automake and libtool stuff was removed.  In the new system, each
  directory (except 'config') has ONLY a 'Makefile' (no more 'Makefile.in' or
  'Makefile.am' files).  When the 'configure' script is run, the single file
  'config/Makefile.config' is created.  This file is included in all Makefiles
  in all sub-directories.  Shared libraries CANNOT be created with this system.

- The makefile targets are now more inline with GNU standards.  To get details,
  type 'make help'.

- The makefile target 'nofei' has been removed and is now run by default.

- The library files 'libHYPRE_blas.a' and 'libHYPRE_lapack.a' are no longer
  created when 'configure' is run '--without-blas' and/or '--without-lapack'.
  This created confusion before and really didn't make sense anyway.  These
  options are now consistent with the '--without-MPI' option.  Also, there is
  no longer any danger of name conflicts with external blas or lapack libraries
  as was the case before.

- Added new parallel coarsening schemes PMIS and HMIS with reduced complexities
  as well as the option of using one pass of Ruge-Stueben only.

- Added the capability to set values from any processor through the IJ matrix
  and vector interfaces.

- Added support to the PFMG solver for matrices with constant coefficients.

************************

Version 1.8.3a released, 2004/01/21.

- The build system has been revamped to enable the building of shared
  libraries (in addition to static libraries, as before).  The new
  system more closely follows GNU standards, and will hopefully show
  improved flexibility and platform support.  Users can build hypre
  as before by typing 'configure' followed by 'make'.  A few makefile
  target changes to note are:

    * 'make clean' replaces 'make veryclean'
    * 'make all' no longer builds the drivers in the 'test' directory.
       If needed, build them from within the 'test' directory or
       use the 'make test' target.

  Technical notes: We are now using GNU automake-1.8.2 to support
  Makefile.in generation; autoconf-2.59 to generate configure; and
  libtool-1.5 to provide shared library support.  The GNU tools,
  autoheader, libtoolize, and aclocal are also used.  These tools are
  only used by hypre developers and are *not* needed to build hypre.

- Separated the lapack and blas routines into two libraries.  Blas and
  lapack support (whether to use the routines distributed with hypre or
  use already installed libraries) is determined by configure, and can
  be overridden with '--with-blas=<lib>' and '--with-lapack=<lib>'.
  NOTE: This change affects your link line!

- A new directory 'lib' contains a new Hypre library, 'libHYPRE.a' (and
  'libHYPRE.so' if configured for shared libraries) which contain
  all of the libHYPRE_*.a objects with in a single library.

- Fixed the PFMG and SMG solvers to work in the case of pure Neumann
  boundary conditions.

Version 1.8.2b released, 2003/10/22.

- Performance improvements for Struct solvers when there are many
  boxes per processor in the grid.  For 125 boxes or more in 3D,
  the speedup in the setup phases of PFMG and SMG can be significant
  (we have seen as much as a factor of 30).
- New non-Galerkin option in PFMG can improve convergence and memory
  usage.  This option maintains either a 5-pt stencil in 2D or a 7-pt
  stencil in 3D on all grid levels.
- New non-symmetric red/black smoother in PFMG can improve
  convergence on some problems.
- New optimizations in the smoothers in PFMG lead to as much as 30%
  faster times.
- Added a new interpolation option to AMG that is useful for solving
  hyperbolic equations.  It treats fine weak connections like fine
  strong connections.

Version 1.8.1b released, 2003/05/21.

- Minor bug fixes and performance improvements.

Version 1.8.0b released, 2003/04/08.

- New Babelized HYPRE interface introduced.  Babel is a tool that
  provides language interoperability.  HYPRE will eventually migrate
  to using Babel exclusively.  See 'docs/babel_transition_info.txt' for
  information on how to use the new interface.
- PFMG: bug fix for red/black relaxation.
- Eigenvalue solver LOBPCG has been added.  See 'docs/lobpcg_info.txt'
  for documentation.

Version 1.7.11a released, 2003/03/14.

- BiCGSTAB has been added to struct and sstruct interface
- added automatic determination of relaxation parameters for use with symmetric
  smoothers in BoomerAMG

Version 1.7.10b released, 2002/12/02.

- New Hybrid solvers available for ParCSR and Struct.
- IJ: Modified the 'GetValues' part of the matrix interface to make
  it possible to get matrix values without knowing the nonzero
  structure.  In particular, added a new option to IJMatrixGetValues,
  and added new routines IJMatrixGetRowCounts, IJMatrixGetLocalRange,
  and IJVectorGetLocalRange.
- SStruct: Fixed a bug when connecting a part to itself with SetNeighborBox.
- FEI: Added a few more smoothers and amg methods in mli, fixed a few memory 
  leaks uncovered by running ale3d, added new aggregation coarsening for 
  handling multiple materials.  For more details, see 
  FEI_mv/fei-hypre/CHANGELOG.

Version 1.7.9b released, 2002/10/18.

- SStruct: Added an if around sorting and eliminating duplicate 
  iUventries so that its only executed when there are at least 2 
  such entries.

Version 1.7.8b released, 2002/09/25.

- SStruct: Changed the MatrixSetSymmetric interface (this was actually
  not implemented before anyway).  The new interface allows much more
  flexibility in controlling which parts of the matrix are symmetric.

- PCG: Option to combine relative and absolute tolerance in convergence test.

Version 1.7.7b released, 2002/08/08.

- limited release SStruct optimizations testing
- the krylov library has been renamed to HYPRE_krylov

Version 1.7.6b released, 2002/03/27.

- SStruct: Changed SetNeighborBox function to allow the case where the
  NeighborBox does not even intersect the grid.  This functionality
  is convenient in some application situations.
- SStruct: Made additional changes to the SetNeighborBox function to
  allow NeighborBox information to be redundantly declared by users.
  This functionality is also convenient in some application situations.
- SStruct: Optimized the implementation of MatrixSetBoxValues.

Version 1.7.5b released, 2002/01/16.

- SStruct: Modified SetNeighborBox boxes to reach off of the global grid.
- krylov solvers (PCG, GMRES, BiCGSTAB and CGNR ) are the first
  solvers to use the new definitions for logging, which are 
  logging = 0: no printout,  no storing of norms or rel. res. norms 
  logging = 1: no printout,  norms (and relative residual norms for PCG) 
               are stored 
  logging > 1: norms (and relative residual norms for PCG) are stored 
               and printed out to standard output during each iteration 
               step. 

Version 1.7.0b released, 2001/11/12.

- Bug fixes: SStruct interface under threads was producing incorrect
  results. That is now fixed.

Version 1.6.0 released, 2001/07/27.

- The Euclid PILU preconditioning library has been added to the release.
  See Section 7.7.5 of the user manual and Section 6.6.4 of the reference
  manual for details.

Version 1.5.0b released, 2001/07/18.

- New draft of the IJ interface: This new draft is not backward compatible
  with the previous draft.  See the file `docs/V1.5.0b.IJ_transition_info'
  for details on transitioning to the new interface.  See the User's Manual
  and Reference Manual for usage information.

- Added SetRelChange option to GMRES solver.

Version 1.4.0b released, 2001/01/10.

- Changed SStruct interface: The SStructGraphAddEntries routine now
  only sets one graph entry at a time.  See the reference manual for
  details on the new prototype and usage.

- Both PCG and GMRES are available now when using the Struct or SStruct
  matrix classes (only one or the other was previously available).

- First working multiprocessor version of SStruct interface.

- Fixed a bug in PILUT that effected multiprocessor runs.

- Additional interface for Krylov solvers: most function calls are
  available with more generic naming, e.g. HYPRE_PCGSetPrecond
  may be called instead of HYPRE_ParCSRPCGSetPrecond or
  HYPRE_StructPCGSetPrecond.

Version 1.3.1b released, 2000/10/12.

Version 1.3.0b released, 2000/10/11.

- The number of threads to use in an OpenMP run can now be specified via
  either the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, or by the routine
  omp_set_num_threads().

- Added fortran interface support for compilers that mangle names with
  all capitals (e.g., Cray fortran compilers).  To use, specify the
  '--with-CFLAGS=-DHYPRE_CRAY' option on the 'configure' line.

Version 1.2.0 released, 2000/09/22.

Version 1.1.0 released, 2000/09/07.

- Setup time for PILUT has been dramatically reduced in the case of
  very small drop tolerances, and memory problems that were causing
  coredumps on >2 processors have been fixed.

- Changed Struct interface include file names to be consistent with
  the rest of the library.  They are now:

    HYPRE_struct_mv.h
    HYPRE_struct_ls.h

  The Struct library names have also changed similarly.

- Removed the `stencil' argument from `HYPRE_StructVectorCreate'.

- Added a new interface for semi-structured grids.  This is still very
  much a beta implementation, and should be used with extreme caution
  until further notice.

- The main header files have been restructured to be more readable.
  They will soon include full documentation for their interfaces.

New internal installation: V1.0.0, 2000/07/06

- Now installing both optimized and debugging versions of the library.
  The optimized library is in the usual place; the debugging library
  is in the subdirectory 'debug'.

- Added support for the FEI v1.4, with additional capabilities for handling
  parallel slide surface reduction and general Schur complement reduction. 

- Using a new version numbering scheme.  The C macro HYPRE_Version()
  may be used to retrieve version information.

New internal installation: V2000-05-31

- OpenMP threading added to BoomerAMG.

- Changed ParAMG names to BoomerAMG.  Use 'bin/V2000-05-31.hypre_convert'
  to convert code to use the new names.

- Changed default coarsening type for BoomerAMG.  This version does
  Ruge/Stueben coarsening on the interior of each processor to generate
  an initial independent set for the CLJP coarsening algorithm.

- Various BoomerAMG optimizations.

New internal installation: V2000-03-30

- New AddToValues and AddToBoxValues routines for Struct interface.

- Fairly extensive changes to SMG/PFMG codes to fix setup phase
  scalability problems.  These changes should result in slightly
  slower setup phase times for small-scale problems, but much
  improved setup phase times for very large-scale (greater than
  1000 processors) problems.

- AMG and GMRES solvers have minor fixes for reproducibility under
  restart.

- A subtle coarse grid operator bug in AMG was removed.  AMG no longer
  frees from an uninitialized pointer to an empty domain coarse grid
  operator.

- Minimum iteration count controls have been installed for AMG, GMRES,
  and CGNR.

- Fortran interface wrappers have been made for ParCSRMatrixMatvec and
  ParCSRMatrixMatvecT calls

New internal installation: V2000-01-14
