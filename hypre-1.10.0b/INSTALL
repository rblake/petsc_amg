HYPRE Installation Information
=================================

The simplest way to build this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints messages
     indicating which features it is checking for.  configure creates two output 
     files, config.status and config.log.  The config.status file can be run to 
     recreate the current configuration, and config.log is useful for debugging 
     configure.  Upon successful completion the file Makefile.config is created 
     from its template Makefile.config.in and HYPRE is ready to be made.

  2. Type `make install' to compile the source code and install the resulting files 

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source code 
     directory by typing `make clean'.  To remove the files that `configure' 
     created (so you can compile the package for a different kind of computer), 
     type `make distclean'.


Optional Features
=================

Configure has many options to allow the user to override and refine the defaults 
of any system.  To find the available options, it is best to display the help 
package which also includes usage information.

The make step in building HYPRE is where the compiling, loading and creation of 
libraries occurs.  Make has several options called targets, which can be listed 
by running 'make help'.  

When building HYPRE without the install target, the libraries and include files 
will be copied into the default directories, hypre/lib and hypre/include, which
are sub-directories of the top-level source directory.
 
When building with the install target, the libraries and files are copied into
the directories that the user specified in the options to configure, e.g.
--prefix=/usr/apps.  If none were specified the default directories are used,
hypre/lib and hypre/include.
