* Write first section.
* Second section: 2.1 new stuff, 2.2 mostly drawn from material
  currently in later sections
* Section 3: Not sure right now. Important, but maybe not qualified
  for independent section. Need to reread what I wrote months ago to
  see what to do with it.
* Section 4: much will probably be moved to Section 2.2.
* Section 5.1: Heart of the paper. Move to its own section.
* Rest of Section 5: Present as application of the theory and better
  algorithm design in own section.

* Need to find out about the color policies on whatever journal and if
  we need to mess with the figures to get them to print well in black
  and white.
