* Need to find out about the color policies on whatever journal and if
  we need to mess with the figures to get them to print well in black
  and white.

* Not too thrilled with the way the comments in the algorithms
  look. The environment being used to generate the algorithms seems to
  conflict with "latex philosophy" in that formatting of the algorithm
  is explicitly affected by how spaces are inserted into the document
  source code. Find out if this algorithm environment has explicit method
  for comments because the pseudocode comments currently look very bad.
